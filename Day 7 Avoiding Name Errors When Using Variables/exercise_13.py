# Create a list of countries

# Use insert() to insert a country at a specific position
countries.insert(2, "Germany")
print("List after inserting:", countries)

# Use remove() to remove a specific country
countries.remove("France")
print("List after removing:", countries)

# Use pop() to remove and return the last country
popped_country = countries.pop()

# Use sort() to sort the list in alphabetical order
countries.sort()

# Use reverse() to reverse the order of the list
countries.reverse()

# Use len() to get the length of the list
num_countries = len(countries)

# Use sorted() to get a sorted version of the list without modifying the original list

# Use index() to find the index of a specific country

# Use count() to count the occurrences of a specific country
