# Mixing Positional and Arbitrary Arguments

'''If you want a function to accept several different kinds of arguments, the
parameter that accepts an arbitrary number of arguments must be placed
last in the function definition. Python matches positional and keyword
arguments first and then collects any remaining arguments in the final
parameter.
For example, if the function needs to take in a size for the pizza, that
parameter must come before the parameter *toppings:'''

def make_pizza(size, *toppings):
    """Summarize the pizza we are about to make."""
    print(f"\nMaking a {size}-inch pizza with the following toppings:")
    for topping in toppings:
        print(f"- {topping}")
make_pizza(16, 'pepperoni')
make_pizza(12, 'mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese')

'''In the function definition, Python assigns the first value it receives to
the parameter size. All other values that come after are stored in the tuple
toppings. The function calls include an argument for the size first, followed
by as many toppings as needed.'''
