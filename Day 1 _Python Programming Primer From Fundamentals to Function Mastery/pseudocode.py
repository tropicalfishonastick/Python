# Ask the user for their name
name = input("What's your name? ")

# Print hello
print("hello,")

# Print the name inputted
print(name)

# We can further edit our code as follows:
# Ask the user for their name
name = input("What's your name? ")

# Print hello and the inputted name
print("hello, " + name)

# It turns out that some functions take many arguments.
# We can use a comma , to pass in multiple arguments by editing our code as follows:
# Ask the user for their name
name = input("What's your name? ")

# Print hello and the inputted name
print("hello,", name)
