'''This class starts with a survey question that you provide 1 and includes an empty list to store responses. 
The class has methods to print the survey question 2, add a new response to the response list 3, 
and print all the responses stored in the list 4. To create an instance from this class, all you have to provide is a question. 
Once you have an instance representing a particular
survey, you display the survey question with show_question(), store a
response using store_response(), and show results with show_results().
To show that the AnonymousSurvey class works, letâ€™s write a program that
uses the class:'''
